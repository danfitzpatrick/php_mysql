PHP/MySQL scripts
=================

Some PHP scripts I have written, which use MySQL as well.

These are all from a few years ago when I was creating many websites of thousands of pages each, putting pay-per-click and affiliate ads on them, and then waiting for the money to roll in. Not too much money came in (although one day I did make a high of $40) but I did learn quite a bit in the process. Eventually I started to feel bad about adding to the garbage that clogs up the internet, and moved on to other projects.

Besides PHP and MySQL, I also learned about Apache, Linux, FTP, SSH, chron jobs, .htaccess, CURL, regular expressions, screen scraping and more.
